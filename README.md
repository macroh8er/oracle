# oracle
Oracle is a Dota 2 interface tool which provides relevant player information from inside the Dota 2 client without the need of third party tools like Overwolf. Oracle is also free, open source and works on all platforms which run Dota 2, Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. Speed and security are a concern when developing Oracle - no game files are edited, there is no process injection or memory fiddling.
